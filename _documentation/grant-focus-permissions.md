When you first launch FocusCuts, or after migrating to a new device, you will need to grant FocusCuts permission to 
read your Focus Mode status. If the popup (below) does not appear automatically, you can trigger it by clicking 
"Request folder access".

When you click OK, a folder picker will pop open at `~/Library/DoNotDisturb/DB/` and you just need to click OK.
