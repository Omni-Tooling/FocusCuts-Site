You can launch FocusCuts automatically at startup through System Preferences. In the Users & Groups pane, go to the Login Items tab, and then add FocusCuts to the list of applications. 

<div class="docs-image">
<object type="image/svg+xml" data="/assets/auto/start-at-login.svg"></object>
</div>

If you want to remove it later, use the `â€”` button to remove FocusCuts from the list of Login Items.
