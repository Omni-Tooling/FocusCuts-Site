title: Grant FocusCuts Permissions to Read Your Shortcuts
published: true

In order for FocusCuts to give you a custom list of Shortuts for each Focus Mode, it needs to read your Shortcuts.
When you first run the app it will pop up a window to ask you to grant access to Shortcuts Events. Clicking OK
grants the permission.
