title: Watch a Folder

If you want to add every Shortcut in a folder to a Focus Mode you can drag the folder to the Shortcuts list, or click the ![Add](/assets/icons/chevron_right.svg) button with the folder selected. If you would rather keep the list of Shortcuts in sync with the folder—rather than a static snapshot at the time you added the folder—you can click _Watch Folder_ in the bottom left. Watched Shortcuts folders in the current Focus Mode are prefixed with ⫸.
