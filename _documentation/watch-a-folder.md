If you want to add every Shortcut in a folder to a Focus Mode you can drag the folder to the Shortcuts list, or click the ![Add](/assets/icons/chevron_right.svg) button with the folder selected. Or you can click _Watch Folder_ in the bottom left which will add all the Shortcuts in the folder, but if you add or remove Shortcuts from that folder in the Shortcuts app, the list of Shortcuts for your Focus Mode will update automatically. Watched Shortcuts folders in the current Focus Mode are prefixed with â«¸.
