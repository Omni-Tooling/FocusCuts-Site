title: Adding Shortcuts to a Focus Mode
published: true
tip: Use the `space` key to add a selected Shortcut or folder to the current Focus Mode. Typing a few characters (such as the start of your Shortcut name) will jump you to the desired Shortcut within the list.

To add Shortcuts to a Focus Mode, open FocusCuts and select the Focus Mode from the drop-down menu on the right-hand side (your current Focus Mode will be preselected). Now you can [Watch a Folder](watch-a-folder.md), add all the Shortcuts in a folder (select the folder and use the <object type="image/svg+xml" class="inline menubar-icon"
data="/assets/icons/chevron_right.svg"></object> button), or select one or more individual Shortcuts and add them.
