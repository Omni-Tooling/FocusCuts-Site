published: true
---
To add Shortcuts to FocusCuts for a Focus Mode, open FocusCuts, and select the Focus Mode from the drop-down menu on the right-hand side (it should pre-select your current Focus mode). Now you can [Watch a Folder](), add all the Shortcuts in a folder (select the folder and use the ![Add](/assets/icons/chevron_right.svg) button), or select one or more Shortcuts and use them.

Tip: Use the space key to add a selected Shortcut or folder to the current Focus Mode.
