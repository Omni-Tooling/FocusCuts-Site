To add Shortcuts to a Focus Mode, open FocusCuts and select the Focus Mode from the drop-down menu on the right-hand side (your current Focus Mode will be preselected). Now you can [Watch a Folder](watch-a-folder.md), add all the Shortcuts in a folder (select the folder and use the ![Add](/assets/icons/chevron_right.svg) button), or select one or more individual Shortcuts and add them.
