Today, we are proud and excited to launch FocusCuts. 

When WWDC happened last year we got some great things, namely Shortcuts for the Mac and Focus Modes. But there was one omission–at least in our view. Shortcuts can't tell you what if a Focus Mode is enabled, or which one is active. We quickly realised this information isn't something you can get on iOS, but you can find it on the Mac!

Something else that came up throughout the last few months is that while Shortcuts has a menu bar app, it is static, and it syncs. This seems like a feature and in many cases it is. However, I host the Automators Podcast with David Sparks, who always talks about contextual computing. Having the right tools easily to hand in current situation isn't a new idea–chefs use it all the time, but it's harder than you would expect in the digital world. So to that end, the FocusCuts menu bar application lets you select which Shortcuts you want to appear–and in which Focus Mode that is. if you want a whole folder of Shortcuts you can add them, or you can even watch a folder so Shortcuts you add to it later just show up. And we know most people with more than one Mac like to use them in different ways–so FocusCuts doesn't sync.
