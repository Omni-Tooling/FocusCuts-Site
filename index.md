## What is FocusCuts
FocusCuts is a macOS status bar application which gives you two Shortcuts actions to get your current Focus Mode and a list of your current Focus Modes. The application also lets you customise a list of Shortcuts to display and quickly run _per_ Focus Mode. So if you want to have a quick list of Shortcuts available for Work, but different ones for Personal, you can do it!

## Requirements
FocusCuts requires macOS Monterey, as previous versions of macOS do not support Shortcuts or Focus Modes.
