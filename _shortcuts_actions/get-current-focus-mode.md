title: Get Currently Active Focus Mode
published: true
---

This action tells you the name of the currently active Focus Mode, or if 
none is set it returns "No focus mode active". This action can be used as 
part of a Shortcut to change which actions your Shortcut runs, or even stop it. The [Is Focus Mode Active]
(#is-focus-mode-active) action may also be useful for this.
