FocusCuts by [Snailed It](https://snailedit.dev) is a status bar application for macOS which gives you two actions for Shortcuts to get your current Focus Mode and a list of all of your Focus Modes. FocusCuts also lets you customise a list of Shortcuts to display and quickly run _per_ Focus Mode. So if you want to have a quick list of Shortcuts available for Work, but different ones for Personal, you can!
