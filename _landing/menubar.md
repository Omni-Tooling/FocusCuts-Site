Take advantage of your current Focus Mode and keep the relevant Shortcuts at hand. You can either select specific 
Shortcuts, add all the Shortcuts in a folder, or even watch folders so new Shortcuts added to it automatically 
appear. You can 
also 
have the name of your current Focus Mode show up, making it easier to spot.
